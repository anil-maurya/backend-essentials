   - Explore data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, objects, and arrays.
3. **Operators:**
   - Learn about arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
4. **Control Flow:**
   - Understand conditional statements (if, else if, else) and switch statements.
   - Explore loop structures like for, while, and do-while.
5. **Functions:**
   - Define functions and understand their purpose.

   - Explore function expressions and arrow functions.
6. **Arrays:**
   - Understand how to work with arrays, including methods like `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift`.
   - Explore array iteration methods like `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
7. **Objects:**
   - Learn about objects and their properties.
   - Understand object methods and how to iterate through object properties.
8. **Asynchronous JavaScript:**
   - Introduction to callbacks, promises, and async/await for handling asynchronous operations.
   - Explore concepts like AJAX and Fetch API for making HTTP requests.
9. **Error Handling**
   - Error Types:
     - Syntax Errors
     - Runtime errors
     - Logical Errors
   - try-catch Statement
   - Error Objects:
     - Different types of error objects like SyntaxError, ReferenceError, TypeError, etc.
     - Extracting information from the error object (e.g., error message, stack trace).
   - Throwing Custom Errors:
     - Creating and throwing custom errors using the throw statement.
     - Defining and using custom error classes.
   - Promises and Async/Await Error Handling:
     - Handling errors in asynchronous code using promises.
     - Using .catch() with promises.
     - Error handling in async/await functions.
   - Global Error Handling:
     - window.onerror event for handling uncaught exceptions globally in the browser.
     - process.on('uncaughtException') in Node.js for global error handling.
   - Error Propagation:
     - Propagating errors up the call stack for centralized handling.
     - Strategies for deciding where to catch and handle errors.
